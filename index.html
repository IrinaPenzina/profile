        I love web-development.<br>
        <br>
        My entire life I thought that people who can code have some sort of a superhero power. It fascinated me how someone was able to create things to make other people’s life easier. When I was 30 years and 11 months old I started looking into it myself. I found out either it’s not that complicated or I’m not as hopeless as I thought.<br>
        <br>
        Before that beautiful coding enlightenment happened in my life I had lived in Russia, gained a Master’s degree in Public relations, for 5 years worked as a PR manager in various fields (most of the time media related), for 3 years worked as an English teacher. I’ve been in China for four years and here my beautiful coding enlightenment took place.<br>
        <br>
        When I was diagnosed with love for coding - first, I built <a href="https://imirina.com/" target="_blank">my website</a>, second, I took SoloLearn (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), third, I took Harvard cs50 (the course includes C, Python, SQLite, JavaScript, Jinja - my final project is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRhBRQdQa14&lc=z22udpxyuqzbgxzoo04t1aokgel04z44t1eocvkrbhbybk0h00410" target="_blank">here</a>) fourth, I was enrolled to Le Wagon. <br>
        <br>
        Now I just can't wait to become a full time web developer. <br>
